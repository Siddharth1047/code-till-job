# code-till-job
This is my personal repo, where I'll upload at least 1 code everyday till I get a job.
My dream is to get a job as a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer / LLM Developer. 
This repository is public and you can use the code or problems from this repository for your studies.
BEST OF LUCK..!!
